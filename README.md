# kubernetes-examples

In this repo:

- Scripts for runnning Kubernetes in Docker on a docker-machine called `hyperkube`
- An example django app for demonstrating rolling updates and load balancing services (The db service reference is broken in k8s, so migrations don't work)
- Some example Kubernetes [`Job`](kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/jobs/)s that you can run from CLI. 
- Some tiny notes from a demo I did
